# Potluck Game and Number Converter
As an assigment of my CS102 class, I implemented a basic Potluck game (Part a), and a number converter (Part b) using Java.
## Potluck Game
I designed and implemented a GUI application that presents a game based on a 5 by 5 matrix of buttons. One of the buttons (selected at random) "hides" the prize, while two of the 
buttons (selected at random, should be different from each other and prize button) hide bombs. A status bar at the bottom of the window shows the number of guesses. When the prize
button is pressed, the status bar shows "You got it in x attempts!". When one of the bomb buttons is pressed, the status bar shows "Sorry! You are blown up at attempt x!" Which 
buttons hid the prize and which ones hid bombs are revealed to the user.
## Number Converter
I designed and implemented a GUI application that converts decimal, hex and binary numbers, as shown in the figure below. When a decimal value is entered in the decimal-value 
text field and the Enter key is pressed, its corresponding hex and binary numbers are displayed in the other two text fields. Similarly, values can be entered in the other fields
and they as well are converted accordingly.
